## How do I use this?
It runs using NodeJS, you will need a NodeJS hosting plan with someone to be able to host it. Simply run the files and the packages will install.

## Requirements
- DiscordJS v12
- Windows/Linux/Mac
- A Discord Bot

**Check out config.json to customize the bot.**
You can change almost everything from there.

If you need help DM **Tomas#9284** on Discord.

Everything should explain itself in the config file, I plan to make it simpler in the future to use, this includes letting commands be disabled from the config file etc.
